The bidirectional CPC model proposed in the paper ["On Scaling Contrastive Representations for Low-Resource Speech Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00850).

The model will be made available before the paper is presented at ICASSP 2021.

A script for loading and extracting representations from .wav-files will be included.
