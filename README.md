## Bidirectional CPC Model for Speech Representations 

The bidirectional CPC model proposed in the paper ["On Scaling Contrastive Representations for Low-Resource Speech Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00850).

See `extract.py` for a simple example of how to run and extract the context representation used in the paper.

Required file format is 16-bit PCM sampled at 16kHz. See `test.wav`.
